# MeetingRoomFinder

##Problems:

* Searching for an apt and available room for meetings is exhausting using default mail applications
* No efficient app that gives an **overview** of all meeting rooms available
* Need for a **suggestion** mechanism, to automatically list down meeting room closer and sooner
* Need for **quick** booking as soon as available 
* Need for avoiding fake booking - **NOSHOW** _(cancel meeting but not the booked meeting room)_

##Features & Ideas:

* Customized to individual employee -uses SSO Single Sign On
* Single click - Overall view of all meeting rooms with availability info around your default location
* One Click suggestions for best available rooms, based on physical proximity and availability
* Quick booking for really short meetings
* Feature extension to detect fake bookings
* Search for a favorite room
* Contact the person who currently occupies the room
